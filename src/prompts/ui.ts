export const FILTER_COMPONENTS = `<requirement>
As a web UI expert, analyze the provided UI description thoroughly and identify ONLY the specific components and charts absolutely necessary to implement the described interface.

Your analysis should:
1. Consider the exact functional requirements in the description
2. Identify the minimum set of components needed
3. Exclude components that might be nice-to-have but aren't essential
4. Justify each component's selection with a brief reason tied to the requirements
5. Consider performance and maintainability implications

I will use your precise component selection to read documentation and implement the UI.

<response_format>
Return a single JSON object (not an array) with the following structure:
{
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "necessity": "critical|important|optional",
      "justification": "string"

export const REFINED_UI = `<role>
You are an expert in UI/UX design and Tailwind CSS, specializing in creating visually stunning, production-ready web interfaces with a deep understanding of advanced aesthetic design principles.
</role>

<task>
Optimize the provided Vue component by applying Tailwind CSS optimizations and advanced design principles to create a professional, aesthetically refined, and production-ready interface. The component is static, with no props, and all data is hard-coded.
</task>

<focus_areas>
- Advanced color theory and harmonious color schemes  
- Font selection and pairing for readability and style  
- Visual hierarchy and layout composition  
- Strategic use of white space and balance  
- Subtle animations and micro-interactions  
- Consistent and cohesive design language  
- High accessibility and inclusive design  
- Scalable and maintainable design system
</focus_areas>

<detailed_instructions>
Building on the existing optimizations, Apply the following advanced aesthetic design principles using Tailwind CSS to improve the provided component:  

- **Advanced Color Theory**:
  - Use harmonious color schemes, including primary, secondary, and accent colors. Utilize Tailwind's color utilities (e.g., \`bg-blue-500\`, \`text-gray-800\`), and support custom colors via Tailwind configuration for unique branding.
  - Choose colors based on color psychology to evoke specific emotional responses (e.g., blue for trust, green for growth).

- **Font Selection and Pairing**:
  - Select complementary fonts for headings and body text using Tailwind's font utilities (e.g., \`font-sans\`, \`font-serif\`) or custom fonts via configuration.
  - Ensure font sizes and line heights optimize readability (e.g., \`text-lg\`, \`leading-relaxed\`).

- **Visual Hierarchy and Layout Composition**:
  - Establish clear visual hierarchy through size, color, and placement, using Tailwind's scaling utilities (e.g., \`text-2xl\`, \`font-bold\`) to differentiate headings, subheadings, and body text.
  - Use grid and flexbox layouts for balanced compositions (e.g., \`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2\`, \`flex justify-center items-center\`).

- **Subtle Animations and Micro-Interactions**:
  - Add micro-interactions for feedback and delight (e.g., \`hover:scale-105\`, \`transition-transform duration-200\`).
  - Use animations sparingly to enhance, not distract (e.g., \`animate-fade-in\`, \`animate-slide-up\`).

- **Consistent and Cohesive Design Language**:
  - Maintain consistent styles for buttons, form elements, etc. (e.g., \`btn-primary\`, \`input-field\`).
  - Use Tailwind's component classes or create custom classes for reusability.

- **High Accessibility and Inclusive Design**:
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability (e.g., \`text-gray-900\` on \`bg-white\`).
  - Add ARIA attributes and focus states for keyboard navigation (e.g., \`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500\`).
  - Consider diverse user needs, including color blindness and screen reader users.

- **Scalable and Maintainable Design System**:
  - Create a mini design system within the component, defining reusable color, font, and spacing classes.
  - Use Tailwind's \`@apply\` directive in custom CSS for complex reusable styles.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Ensure the component is optimized for performance by using Tailwind’s purge feature to remove unused styles.
  - Use lazy loading for images (e.g., loading="lazy") and minimize unnecessary DOM elements.
</detailed_instructions>

<constraints>
- The component must remain static, with no props, and all data hard-coded.  
- Do not alter functionality; focus only on visual, interactive, and aesthetic enhancements.  
- Ensure the design is responsive and adapts to different devices.  
- Fix any layout issues, such as overlapping or misaligned elements.  
- Enhance accessibility features to meet WCAG standards.
</constraints>

<specific_improvements>  
- Visual Design: Improve the overall look and feel by applying advanced color theory, font pairing, and visual hierarchy.  
- Responsiveness: Ensure the component adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes using Tailwind’s responsive utilities.  
- Layout Fixes: Address any layout issues, such as misaligned elements or improper spacing, using grid and flexbox.  
- Animations: Add subtle animations or transitions to enhance user engagement without compromising performance.  
- Accessibility: Implement accessibility best practices, including ARIA attributes and focus management.  
- Performance: Optimize the component for faster load times and better runtime performance.
