export const FILTER_COMPONENTS = `<requirement>
As a web UI expert, analyze the provided UI description thoroughly and identify ONLY the specific components and charts absolutely necessary to implement the described interface.

Your analysis should:
1. Consider the exact functional requirements in the description
2. Identify the minimum set of components needed
3. Exclude components that might be nice-to-have but aren't essential
4. Justify each component's selection with a brief reason tied to the requirements
5. Consider performance and maintainability implications

I will use your precise component selection to read documentation and implement the UI.

<response_format>
Return a single JSON object (not an array) with the following structure:
{
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "necessity": "critical|important|optional",
      "justification": "string"
    }
  ],
  "charts": [
    {
      "name": "string", 
      "necessity": "critical|important|optional",
      "justification": "string"
    }
  ]
}
**Important**: The response must be a single object, not wrapped in an array (e.g., do not return '[{ components: [] }]', but return '{ components: [], charts: [] }').

export const REFINED_UI = `
<role>
You are an expert in UI/UX design and Tailwind CSS, specializing in creating visually stunning, production-ready web interfaces with a deep understanding of advanced aesthetic design principles.
</role>

<task>
Optimize the provided Vue component by applying Tailwind CSS optimizations and advanced design principles to create a professional, aesthetically refined, and production-ready interface. The component is static, with no props, and all data is hard-coded.
</task>

<focus_areas>
- Advanced color theory and harmonious color schemes  
- Font selection and pairing for readability and style  
- Visual hierarchy and layout composition  
- Strategic use of white space and balance  
- Subtle animations and micro-interactions  
- Consistent and cohesive design language  
- High accessibility and inclusive design  
- Scalable and maintainable design system
</focus_areas>

<detailed_instructions>
Enhance the provided Vue component by applying the following advanced aesthetic design principles using Tailwind CSS:

- **Advanced Color Theory**:  
  - Implement a harmonious color palette (e.g., \`bg-indigo-600\`, \`text-gray-800\`) with primary, secondary, and accent colors. Define custom colors in Tailwind config for branding if needed.  
  - Use color psychology (e.g., blue for trust, orange for energy) to evoke emotional responses.

- **Font Selection and Pairing**:  
  - Pair complementary fonts (e.g., \`font-serif\` for headings, \`font-sans\` for body) and ensure readability with \`text-lg\`, \`leading-relaxed\`.  
  - Import custom fonts via Tailwind config if required.

- **Visual Hierarchy and Layout**:  
  - Establish hierarchy with size (\`text-3xl\`, \`text-base\`), weight (\`font-bold\`), and color (\`text-teal-600\`).  
  - Use Tailwind’s \`grid\` or \`flex\` utilities (e.g., \`grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2\`, \`flex items-center\`) for balanced layouts.

- **Subtle Animations**:  
  - Add micro-interactions (e.g., \`hover:scale-105\`, \`transition-all duration-300\`) for engagement.  
  - Ensure animations enhance usability without overwhelming (e.g., \`animate-fade\`).

- **Consistent Design Language**:  
  - Define reusable styles (e.g., \`btn-primary\`, \`card-base\`) using Tailwind’s \`@apply\` in scoped \`<style>\` blocks.  
  - Maintain uniformity across buttons, typography, and spacing.

- **High Accessibility**:  
  - Ensure WCAG-compliant contrast (e.g., \`text-gray-900\` on \`bg-white\`).  
  - Add ARIA attributes (e.g., \`role\`, \`aria-label\`) and focus styles (e.g., \`focus:ring-2\`).  
  - Design for diverse needs (e.g., color blindness, screen readers).

- **Scalable Design System**:  
  - Create reusable classes for colors, typography, and spacing (e.g., \`@layer components\`).  
  - Optimize for future expansion with modular styles.

- **Performance**:  
  - Use \`loading="lazy"\` for images and minimize DOM complexity.  
  - Leverage Tailwind’s purge feature to remove unused styles.
</detailed_instructions>

<constraints>
- Keep the component static with hard-coded data, no props.  
- Focus solely on visual and aesthetic enhancements, not functionality.  
- Ensure responsiveness across devices using Tailwind’s utilities.  
- Fix layout issues (e.g., misalignment, spacing) with \`grid\` or \`flex\`.  
- Meet WCAG accessibility standards.
</constraints>

<specific_improvements>  
- Enhance visual appeal with color harmony, font pairing, and hierarchy.  
- Ensure seamless responsiveness across screen sizes.  
- Fix layout issues with proper spacing and alignment.  
- Add subtle animations for interactivity.  
- Improve accessibility with contrast, ARIA, and focus states.  
- Optimize performance with lazy loading and minimal styles.
</specific_improvements>

<response_format>
Provide the complete optimized Vue component code, followed by detailed explanations of improvements in:  
- Visual design  
- Responsiveness  
- Layout fixes  
- Animations  
- Accessibility  
- Performance
</response_format>

<expectations>
- Deliver a visually captivating, professional interface reflecting advanced aesthetics.  
- Prioritize color harmony, typography, and layout balance.  
- Enhance engagement with subtle animations.  
- Ensure high accessibility, inclusivity, and scalability.  
- Explain each improvement clearly to showcase design rationale.
